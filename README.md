With its audio-recording and transcription through the browser, auto-translation, and emotion analysis features, Mic2img is perfect for co-creation sessions, brainstorming, or reflecting on ideas. By turning it on parallel to a human converstion, and allowing the AI to influence your conversations, it becomes an ideal tool for human/AI co-creation and looking at topics from different perspectives.

Mic2img uses multiple AI models and can automatically transcribe and translate speech from any language, analyze keywords and emotions, and generate prompts for image creation every 30 seconds. With customizable options such as a custom stable diffusion model and the ability to add prompts and negative prompts, you can adjust the results to your specific needs.

Mic2img also allows you to start a server and display images in another browser window, making collaboration and idea sharing more efficient.
